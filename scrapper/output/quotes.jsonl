Our parents were friends, and when Mom heard her friends needed childcare help, she recommended me and everything fell into place.", "From the start, Jeffrey was a normal kid - energetic, fun-loving, fond of playing and making messes. Most days we\u2019d run around until he wore himself out.", "When Jeffrey was seven, his mother Joan got him a dog. He\u2019d been begging for one for months. Everything started off fine - he fed it, played with it, even walked it outside (with supervision). The two of them seemed perfect together. Then, one day, I found Rex in the yard outside, dead. I immediately called Joan, and she came home early and broke the news to Jeffrey. He seemed devastated, crying and screaming \u201cno!\u201d  But when his mom looked away, I happened to glance in his direction and, just for a moment, it was like a mask fell away and his face had absolutely no emotion. At all.", "They buried Rex in the backyard and life moved on. But I couldn\u2019t get that expression out of my mind. It was terrifying, and it made me remember things I\u2019d dismissed because they hadn\u2019t made sense. Action figures killing without remorse. Scenes of bloodshed on the television whenever I stepped away. Late reactions when other people showed emotions, as if he\u2019d been waiting to mimic them. Off-putting, but nothing definitive - maybe he was just a weird kid.", "This morning, I\u2019d just arrived when I heard a scream. I ran over to find Joan collapsed at the bottom of the stairs, arm twisted awkwardly, head bleeding. Next to her was a small stuffed animal.", "I immediately called 911 and then stayed with Joan until the ambulance came. She woke up while the EMTs attended to her and said it was her fault - she\u2019d tripped over her son's stuffed animal by accident.", "But it wasn\u2019t an accident. Jeffrey was playing with that exact stuffed animal last night. I\u2019d told him to put it away when he was done so that no one would trip over it, and he\u2019d gotten the strangest look on his face. Almost like\u2026 excitement.", "They loaded Joan into the ambulance and I said I\u2019d bring Jeffrey to the hospital. As we drove, he said he had to use the bathroom, so I pulled off the road to find one.", "Later, I sat on a different stretcher, my head bandaged as I answered the officer\u2019s questions. No, I didn\u2019t see who took Jeffrey. No, I don\u2019t know which direction they went. No, I don\u2019t remember anything after something hit my head.", "I stare past my car, door open and surrounded by crime scene tape, to the deep lake beyond. It\u2019s a shame - Joan doesn\u2019t deserve this, and I\u2019ll do my best to be there for her. But there was no choice. Jeffrey was a budding serial killer.", "And there isn\u2019t room for two."]}
